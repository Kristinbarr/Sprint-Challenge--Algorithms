## Exercise I

a) Linear Time
As it n grows, it will loop as many time in direct relation to the input n. The variable 'a' is updating similarly to the conditions in the while loop condition. If n is 2, it loops 1 time. If n is 3, it loops 2 times. If n is 4, it loops 3 times, etc.


b) Log-Linear Time
The first for loop iteration count is directly dependant on n. The inner while loop is logarithmic since the conditional logic decreases logarithmically with n. The outer loop still has to run for n times but the inner loop is logarithmic.

c)
